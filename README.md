# C-file-combiner


Here is a piece of code copied from an old issue of Byte Magazine from 1983. It's been (slightly) modified to work with modern compilers. 

To run compile with gcc or compiler of your choice and run the executable followed by the names of file that need to be combined together. 


Enjoy
